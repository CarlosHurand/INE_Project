# INE_Project

This was a school project and worked just as asked by the professor.
It is not complete as the complete version got lost but there where no mayor changes from this version.

A program that saves user given ID Cards and stores them using the mexican ID format known as INE.

The user gives the programm every part of the INE field by field and after saving them, you can print or delete existing INEs.
